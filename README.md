## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout

### What I learned

This project helped me practice using Flexbox for centering elements and organizing a simple layout. I also worked on using CSS custom properties for better maintainability. Implementing a responsive design and understanding how to use the `figure` and `img` tags more effectively were part of the learning experience.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to explore more advanced layouts using CSS Grid and further improve accessibility practices, such as optimizing alt text for images and improving color contrast ratios.
